It seems like technical news is always talking about how neural network models are helping predict this or detect that. For example, a recent article came out describing how [MIT researchers have developed a model that can identify 97% of COVID-19 just by a person’s cough—even in asymptomatic people](https://www.sciencealert.com/ai-cough-analysis-could-detect-covid-19-even-if-you-re-asymptomatic). When you first hear it without any background, immediately, it sounds like something that is way beyond what you can comprehend. Why? Because it sounds like it has something to do with the brain and that sounds complicated.

However, when you take the time to digest slowly digest this model, you realize that it is made up of very familiar parts. Check out his video series for great visuals: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqOfi41LfDw&ab_channel=StatQuestwithJoshStarmer

Basically, we see how an input is transformed by being fed into a linear equation with set weight and y-intercept that i
